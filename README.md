# Jonica Modpack for SimCity 4
This repository contains the entire modpack currently used in the Jonica region.

## Features

This JSON file allows you to install the Jonica modpack that I currently use in my standard gameplay.

Please note that this modpack is only compatible with SimCity 4 version 1.1.641 (digital version available on Steam, GOG, and EA App). SimCity 4 versions other than the one indicated cannot install this modpack.

Please note that this package will receive updates in the near future. Please do not redistribute it without first asking for permission, as this would complicate the efforts required to maintain, update, and provide adequate technical support for the package. 

## Installation

Start SC4Pac and create a new instance. After creating the new instance, go to the My Plugins section and press the Import button to import the modpack.
